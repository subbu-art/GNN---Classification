# Graph Neural Network (GNN) for Citation Data Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) for node classification tasks on the Cora dataset. The models leverage the graph structure of citation networks to classify academic papers into different categories.

## Features
- Utilizes GCN and GAT architectures for node classification in citation networks.
- Provides scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- Includes visualization tools for analyzing model performance and graph representations.

## Requirements
- Python (>=3.6)
- PyTorch (>=1.7.1)
- torch-geometric (>=2.0.1)
- matplotlib, numpy, pandas (for visualization and data manipulation)
